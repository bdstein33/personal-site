# To Do:
- Add disabled prop to buttons and disable NEW QUESTION BUTTON if there are no sections

- Tests for endpoints (dev optimization)

- Use Promise.resolve to handle errors in actionCreator

- Add scopes to models (in particular password vs regular scope for user)
- Add model associations
- Double check autoIncrement necessity
- Add icon library
- Documentation for functions -- figure out how to convert into pretty output
